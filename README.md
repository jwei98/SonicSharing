# SonicSharing

<h2> Description </h2>

Software written during PennApps 2016 Hackathon.
Progressive web app allows computers and devices to transfer information
peer-to-peer without any network connections; rather, this program
uses sound to share information by converting files into their Base-64
encoding scheme and mapping each character to a sound frequency.
When the host computer plays various sound frequencies in succession,
the receving computer can record the frequencies played and reconstruct
the original file.
